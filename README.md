# Stopwatch App

This is a simple stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch timer.

## How to Use

1. **Starting the Stopwatch**: Click on the "Start" button to start the stopwatch. Once started, the timer will begin counting up in seconds.

2. **Stopping the Stopwatch**: While the stopwatch is running, you can click on the "Stop" button to pause the timer. Clicking "Start" will resume the timer from where it was paused.

3. **Resetting the Stopwatch**: Click on the "Reset" button to reset the timer back to 00:00. This action will also stop the timer if it's currently running.

## Features

- **Dynamic Background**: The app features a dynamic background created using ParticleJS library, providing an engaging visual experience.

- **Disabled Buttons**: The "Stop" and "Reset" buttons are initially disabled. They become active only after starting the stopwatch, preventing unintended actions.

- **Random Border Radius**: As the stopwatch runs, the container's border radius changes dynamically, adding a subtle visual effect.

## File Structure

- **HTML (index.html)**: Contains the structure of the stopwatch app, including the timer display and control buttons.

- **CSS (style.css)**: Defines the styles for the app, including layout, colors, and button appearance.

- **JavaScript (script.js)**: Implements the functionality of the stopwatch, including starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.

## Dependencies

- **ParticleJS**: Used to create the dynamic background effect.

## How to Run

To run the stopwatch app locally, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Make sure to have an active internet connection to load the ParticleJS library.
